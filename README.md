JetStream is an RPC framework built on top of [s2n-quic](https://crates.io/crates/s2n-quic) and [p9](https://crates.io/crates/p9). It's designed to be a high performance, low latency, secure, and reliable RPC framework.

Features:

- Bidirectional streaming
- 0-RTT
- [mTLS](https://github.com/aws/s2n-quic/tree/main/examples/s2n-mtls)
