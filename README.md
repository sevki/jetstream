JetStream is an RPC framework built on top of [s2n-quic](https://crates.io/crates/s2n-quic) and [p9](https://crates.io/crates/p9). It's designed to be a high performance, low latency, secure, and reliable RPC framework.

Features:

- [Bidirectional streaming](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/99/materials/slides-99-quic-sessb-quic-unidirectional-and-bidirectional-streams-01)
- [0-RTT](https://blog.cloudflare.com/even-faster-connection-establishment-with-quic-0-rtt-resumption/)
- [mTLS](https://github.com/aws/s2n-quic/tree/main/examples/s2n-mtls)
- [binary encoding](https://docs.rs/jetstream_wireformat/latest/jetstream_wireformat/)

## Motivation

Building remote filesystems over internet, is the main motivation behind JetStream.
